# Introduction
The app is designed to provide basic calculation functionality.

## File structure
- `style.css` - Defines the styling guidelines
- `calculation.js` - Defines functionality of the calculator
- `calculator.html` - Defines outlook of the app.

## Features of the Calculator App
- Write complete mathematical expressions
- Calculator can be used via keyboard

## Things to Note
- `Infinity` keyword is considered as a token.
- JSdocs are included to clearly define the use of each function

## Further Improvements
- `calculation.js` uses `eval` function to calculate the expression. Which is not a suggested way, so a custom function can be written.
- Calculator does not have functionalities for calculating trignometric functions, like sine, cosine, tan etc. And similarly no such sophisticated scientific features are included.
